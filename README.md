# WorldTreeSweeper Unity Game

This game was created using the Unity Game Engine with a solo-type RPG in mind, with the task of controlling the avatar through challanging terrain and difficult enemies. When creating this game, real world physics that learned in Grade 11 and 12 was taken into consideration and different principles such as gravity, acceleration, mass, and forces were applied when programming the character to move at the player's command. The player uses arrow keys to navigate through difficult terrain. 

Overall, this project is a world exploration game that includes real world physics to control objects and complete the objective of reaching a final destination.

A playable demo version of this game is available through the following Unity Play link:

Please note that this is an unreleased work. 
This project is a game created using Unity engine and consists of many openly liscensed packages from the Unity Asset Store.
When opening the project:
1. Download the zip file
2. Unzip the download
3. Open the file in Unity Hub after installing necessary extensions
4. Select "WorldTreeSweeperFinal" as the project to open in the Unity Hub

Please note that this project is still in a work in progress as there is an interference with various components such as the meshes and the collision code that prevents the player from having a smooth experience. The game is being further developed to provide a more smoother gameplay, more exciting challenges, and varying objectives.

Thank You
